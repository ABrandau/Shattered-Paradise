This mod will likely not run on the current ORA bleed version, first because it may be outdated
and second because it uses custom code that requires some work to install into the latest bleed.
Therefore I recomend you to follow these steps.

1) Download the archive of the master branch of: https://github.com/ABrandau/OpenRA
2) Download the archive of the master branch of: https://github.com/ABrandau/OpenRA.Mods.AS
3) Extract the mod somewhere. 
4) place the AS logics folder inside the mod, all their files must be on a folder named 
OpenRA.Mods.AS, which should be located in the openra folder.
5) Paste the mod on the mods folder located inside the openra folder.
6) open make.cmd, type dependencies, wait until the process is comeplete and close.
7) open make.cmd again, type all, wait unit the process is complete and close.
8) the game and mod should be playable now.

IMPORTANT: Shattered Paradise does NOT have downloadable assets. If you try to download them
you will enter an endless loop (which is my fault for not knowing / searching how to fix it),
please download the Tiberian Sun assets instead and the problem should stop.
